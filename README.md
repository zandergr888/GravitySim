# Gravity Simulation with Barnes-Hut Algorithm

This is a gravity simulation project that utilizes the Barnes-Hut algorithm to efficiently compute the gravitational interactions between celestial bodies.

## Overview

The gravity simulation uses the Barnes-Hut algorithm, which is an approximation algorithm that reduces the computational complexity of calculating gravitational forces in a system with a large number of celestial bodies. It improves performance by dividing the space into a hierarchical tree structure and approximating distant clusters of bodies as a single entity.

The simulation provides a visual representation of celestial bodies influenced by gravity. It demonstrates the motion of the celestial bodies as they interact and orbit around each other.

## Features

- Efficient computation of gravitational forces using the Barnes-Hut algorithm
- Real-time visualization of celestial bodies and their movements
- Adjustable simulation parameters such as mass, initial positions, and velocities of celestial bodies
- User-friendly interface for interactive exploration of the simulation


### Visualization

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- JavaFX library
